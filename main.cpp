// FINAL REQUIREMENTS
//F.Demonstrate the program’s required functionality by adding a main() 
//function in main.cpp, which will contain the required function calls to achieve the following results :
//
//1.  Print out to the screen, via your application, the course title, 
//the programming language used, your WGU student ID, and your name.
//2.  Create an instance of the Roster class called classRoster.
//3.  Add each student to classRoster.
//4.  Convert the following pseudo code to complete 
//the rest of the  main() function :
//
//classRoster.printAll();
//classRoster.printInvalidEmails();
////loop through classRosterArray and for each element:
//
//classRoster.printAverageDaysInCourse(/*current_object's student id*/)
//classRoster.printByDegreeProgram(SOFTWARE);
//classRoster.remove("A3");
//classRoster.printAll();
//classRoster.remove("A3");
//
////expected: the above line should print a message saying such a student with this ID was not found.
//
//5.  Implement the destructor to release the memory that was allocated dynamically in Roster.
